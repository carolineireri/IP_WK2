        <h3>Ever wondered what your name would be if you were ghanian?</h3>
        <h4>The interesting naming tradition of the ghanian people.</h4>
        <br />
        <hr />
        <p>
          In ghana, the Akan people mostly name their children after the day of
          the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These
          "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of
          the person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer
          to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name. This
          is a naming tradition that is shared throughout West Africa.
